## ðŸ”¹ What is DumbBot?

**DumbBot was a personal project I created a long time ago to quickly create and run React apps on a single screen and in a single icon in the systray.**

About the name: _`"BOT, is a software application that performs automated tasks." Wikipedia`_. DumbBot is a bot designed to do tasks automatically, but it is dumb, because by default the application does nothing, you need to install/create some modules for it to do something.
